# Future_Tanks
Single player Tank battle game using particle and beam weapons. 
Played on real world landscapes/terrains as created from GIS data.

##
GDD -

Tank game where you drive a tank through the landscape while avoiding or fighting the enemy tanks and pill boxes. 
Get to the control point at the end and win.

There will be reload points along the way that you will need to secure.

Enemy tanks will have an aim time that will keep them from “snap-shooting” you the moment they see you.



Create world -> Since we have done the low poly idea before we will create a real landscape using a capture form geo sat surveys.  Then put in buildings, trees, grass, roads, etc. Don’t get too carried away at first. Let’s make sure that we keep moving on the rest of the game as we add things into the landscape.
 
Create tank -> Tank will have the basics for the test of the project. However let’s work on it using particle and beam weapons instead of a ballistic shell. Future tanks will incorporate a more futuristic design.

Create Controls -> Basic W,A,S,D driving controls with turret movement on the mouse. Firing controls can be placed anywhere but we will place it on the mouse for the default set-up

Program the AI -> AI tanks will need to be more realistic. Think before shooting and not use “snap-shot” tactics. As time goes we need to make it “more intelligent” by making sure that the driving is what a human would do and not aimless movement just to get a good shot in OR get to the next way point.

Create the UI -> Not too complex. We can work on esthetics and complexity later. Let’s just KISS it.
